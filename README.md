## An expense tracker

### Brief description

- The application allows users to track their expenses by marking down their expenses. 
- Users can set a **budget** for each month, week, or day. 
- Users can put down the **expense**, the **category** of the expense, the **payment method**, and the **date of transaction**. 
- Users will be **notified** when the total expense <= budget - 10. Notification will be displayed in the application when the user enters an expense that makes the total expenses almost goes beyond the budget (10 bucks away). 
- (Visualization) A **pie chart** that shows the expenses and the category of the expenses in a month will be displayed. 
- Target users are people who want to keep track of their expenses. 
- I am interested in building an expense tracker because I often find it hard to keep track of my expenses. I unconsciously spend a lot more than expected. Most of the trackers only keep track of the expenses, but not reminding the users that they spend too much. Hence, I would like to design a tracker that helps users on financial planning.
