# consoleUI

## Introduction
The consoleUI is the Todo List App which runs in the console. It performs the operations such as adding a todo, removing a todo, sorting the todo list, filtering the todo list by due date. 

Data persistence for the todo list is maintained by JSON. By 'saving' the todo list, the JsonWriter will write a JSON file. By 'loading' a todolist with the given name, a JsonReader will read the file.
