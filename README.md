# consoleUI

## Introduction
The consoleUI is the Todo List App which runs in the console. It performs the operations such as adding a todo, removing a todo, sorting the todo list, filtering the todo list by due date. 

Data persistence for the todo list is maintained by JSON. By 'saving' the todo list, the JsonWriter will write a JSON file. By 'loading' a todolist with the given name, a JsonReader will read the file. 

# REST API Todo List App

Due to time constraint and my lack of understanding on REST API, I tried my best to learn about REST API and develop a REST API Todo List App. However, I could not complete the implementation before the deadline. I sincerely apologize for my inability. The Swagger Document in YAML is available in the **restAPI folder in the src directory**. 

I tried to generate a REST API Todo List App with the help of Swagger.io. Nevertheless, I failed to fully implement and test the API within the time limit.
